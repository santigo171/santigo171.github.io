            “If you youngsters don't assume the course of your own country,
            nobody will come to save it, Nobody!”. That is, in my opinion, the
            best way that Jaime's beliefs can be summed up. He was the
            trailblazer of political humor that represents an entire society.
            The laughter in his presentations and speeches has been opening our
            eyes to reveal corruption and oligarchy in a country that has been
            fighting against them since 70 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaime is known for being a journalist, critic, and sociologist that
            was born on the 24th of October of 1960 in Bogotá. He studied law in
            the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Before coming forward to
            television, he become the mayor of Sumapaz (A locality of Bogotá) in
            the administration of Andrés Pastrana, also worked in the
            translation of the new Colombian constitution of 1991, and was a
            peace negotiator in FARC’s kidnapped liberations.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we can’t talk about Jaime without contextualizing the Colombian
            conflict, a war where militias and guerrillas are a threat to the
            government and the citizens. They are clashing for the control of
            zones all around the country. As of today, regions on the pacific
            coast, the llanos or Magdalena Medio are under armed group
            occupancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of this instability, both Garzon’s and our generation
            have a corrupt state. Where circumstances don’t change, people are
            easily dissuaded by politicians, and the illegal groups “do their
            things”. Jaime’s ambition was to expose all these scams to society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is when he entered television. “Zoociedad” was a TV show hosted
            by Jaime Garzón and Elvia Lucia Dávila in Cinevisión. A social
            parody that satirized the security condition of the country and the
            drug war. Then in 1995 Garzon worked in ¡Quac! with Diego León
            Hoyos, another production, closed down in 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Jaime gave life to Heriberto de la Calle, his most popular
            character, a poor boot polisher that appeared in Lechuza and
            Noticiero CM& and all Colombians love, was his last interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I admire him. He is recognized for his frankness free of hesitation
            at the time of criticizing corrupts. To the point of receiving death
            threats, but he didn't stop. Unfortunately, 5 shots ended his life,
            on the morning of 13th august of 1999. At the age of 38, Garzón was
            murdered by the militia. He had no sons but he was the father of all
            Colombians. Up to today, the country cry his death.
          </p>
          <p>
            We, the Colombians, must remember Garzón's legacy and work hard to
            convert our homeland into a peaceful place. We have to fight not
            with weapons, but by informing ourselves, voting, and then ensuring
            that our government is fulfilling. After all that, it’s time to
            instill this process in our sons. We all collectively can end with
            corruption and ignorance.
          </p>
